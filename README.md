# Chargers Link

Chargers Link is the desired Mobile Application that centralizes information within one location for the student community at Capitol Technology University!

## About 
This was a project that began due to Senior Design which led the developer to be ambitious in creating a mobile application for Android & IOS devices 
designed for the students made by someone who is involved with the student community. This is an application that is meant to unite the various resources 
the university provides into one centralized location. This is meant to allow students ease of access to various resources and improve quality of life as a result.

## What is the Objective?
The objective is to have all of the resources that Capitol Technology University has available for the student community to access and utilize for their needs. 
This is aimed at helping students who live on campus alongside those who are commuters. This is not meant to replace any of the current tools such as 
MyCaptiol or cap tech u Safety, instead it is meant to consolidate everything within one location.


## Getting familiar with Chargers-Link?
To understand the code, we highly recommend that you go within the lib folder and see the resources there to understand how the application was created. 
It is important to note that some files should not be touched due to how certain files are just utilized as a foundation for the rest. 
However, before going there **please read the following section about pubspec.yaml**.


#### Pubspec.yaml
pubspec.yaml is a file where we store our dependencies and files for the images currently. As you can see a portion of the code that refers to the images looks like the following:
```
  assets:
  # When you want to add a new icon or image please add them here and the folders named assets
    - assets/techquinox-logo.png
    - assets/Cap-Map.png
    - assets/Cap.png
    - assets/git.png
    - assets/leet.png
    - assets/Py.png
    - assets/VS.png

```

**However** it is important to note that the file you referring to is present within in capitol_app/assets/ & capitol_app/build/flutter_assets/assets/, if not you will be running into various errors.
